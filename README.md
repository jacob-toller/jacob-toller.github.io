Hi.

What you're currently seeing is a placeholder for what will eventually be my website; used as my personal portfolio for people who might be looking to hire me.
My plan for this is to eventually lay out an overview of all the projects that I've worked on; but in the meantime, just get in touch with me at jacobjamestoller@gmail.com
