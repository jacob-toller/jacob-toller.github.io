Hi.

What you're currently seeing is a placeholder for what will eventually be my website; used as my personal portfolio for people who might be looking to hire me[^1]; but also as a space for me to write/blog about personal interests.

My plan for this is to eventually lay out an overview of all the projects that I've worked on; but in the meantime, just get in touch with me at jacobjamestoller@gmail.com

[My CV can be found here](https://github.com/jacob-toller/jacob-toller.github.io/blob/main/Jacob%20Toller%20CV.pdf)

[1^]: As of May 2025, I am employed and not job seeking.
