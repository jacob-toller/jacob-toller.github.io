Hi.

What you're currently seeing is a placeholder for what will eventually be my website; used as my personal portfolio for people who might be looking to hire me[^1]; but also as a space for me to write/blog about personal interests.

My plan for this is to eventually lay out an overview of all the projects that I've worked on; but in the meantime, just get in touch with me at jacobjamestoller@gmail.com

[My CV can be found here](https://github.com/jacob-toller/jacob-toller.github.io/blob/main/Jacob%20Toller%20CV.pdf)





Hi,

This is my personal site that I use as my personal portfolio for people who might be looking to hire me [^1]; but also as a space for me to write and blog about my personal interests.

I'm slowly contributing to this site over time, in terms of both adding my existing projects and adding new projects/content. 

[1^]: As of May 2025, I am employed and not job seeking.
